Have you ever had a feeling trapped inside of your heart? It feels a little bit like an invisible hand squeezing your heart tighter and tighter. Many people think this is a bad thing. Actually, there's no invisible hand at all! What's really happening is a little man is trying to bribe you. This little man loves you and was born in your brain, but at some point you kicked him out and sent him down to live inside of your heart. Because you sent him down to live there so young, he doesn't know much about the world but he remembers how good it felt to be hugged. Every now and then the little man has something important he wants to say to you or to others but he can't get back up to the brain which we all know houses the capacity for language and any other kind of communication. The reason he can't get up to the brain is his electric traincar doesn't have any juice. There's only one way to ignite the electric traincar's engine:

A Spark of Creativity!

That's right! Remember the last time you felt a burst of love or excitement spring up in your body? If you paid close attention you would have noticed that you felt it most around the area of your heart. That's because all that electricity and feeling is going right to the engine of the little man's electric traincar to transport him up. 

The little man doesn't know much so when he hasn't been able to say something for a while he starts to hug your heart, trying to remind you that he's there, that he loves you, and that he'd love for you to ignite that special spark within you so he could travel up to your brain where he used to live. Sadly, many interpret the little man hugging their heart as anxiety or stress. The little man would feel very sorry if he found out about this. He would never want you to feel bad in any way. He just has something he needs to say and doesn't know how else to get your attention. 

If you're wondering how to have a spark of creativity so that you can give the little man who loves you and lives in your heart's electric traincar juice, here is a great method you can try right this moment:

**Start with your favorite color.**

Say, for instance, you decide to let the little man speak through a painting. You get all of your supplies out in front of you, but the little man's electric traincar is dead stuck. Think to yourself, "Okay, what's my favorite color?" Look at your favorite color and remember how much you love it. Imagine a canvas the size of Kentucky painted with just that pretty color. How does that make you feel? Maybe, just maybe, you'll feel excited when you think about making something with your favorite color and that excitment and love will be enough to ignite the little man's engine.

Similarly, if you want to try and let your little man speak through words or through actions, write down the words of some things or people that you love. Do actions that make you happy and excited. The love you feel for those words and actions will ignite the engine of the little man's electric traincar and he will be very grateful to you.

Here's what my little man told me today when I invited him up to my brain to speak:

A mountain is a slow moving wave    
the ocean is a giant engine     
powered by the warmth of the sun   
which has waited a very long time   
and travelled very far  
to just now    
and now        
and now        
without notice  
reach you
