I had a dream last night I was at a concert with my friends. The band was playing on the stage and I was off to the side. A big group of 20 or so of my friends took off their shoes and started dancing in the grass in front of the stage. Eventually, I joined them. We were all completely absorbed by the music, our hearts synchronized to the beat of the rhythm. I wasn't thinking about anything else but the joy I was experiencing and the soft, cold grass on my feet. "Every day could be like this" some voice spoke to me before I woke up.

In my waking life I'm constantly plagued by something like a guilt for existing happily. Perhaps it sounds trite, but to me it's the absolute truth: all over the Earth at this very moment are weeping mothers and terrified children. Their lives are miserable. They are hungry or scared or both. And despite how easy it is to cast your attention elsewhere, especially when you are surrounded by such luxury as many of us are, they are still there, suffering silently, lost in the abyss, drowning in sorrow. I can't shake the feeling that somehow *I am responsible* if I don't do anything to help them. Anytime I am not suffering myself, the question of how any of us can possibly fall asleep at night whilst this is occurring hovers over me like a dark shadow.

The following passage from Albert Camus' *The Plague* captures this insight (or perhaps you may prefer "feeling") perfectly:

>For many years I've been ashamed, mortally ashamed, of having been, even with the best intentions, even at many removes, a murderer in my turn. As time went on I merely learned that even those who were better than the rest could not keep themselves nowadays from killing or letting others kill, because such is the logic by which they live; and that we can't stir a finger in this world without the risk of bringing death to somebody. Yes, I've been ashamed ever since; I have realized that we all have plague, and I have lost my peace. And today I am still trying to find it; still trying to understand all those others and not to be the mortal enemy of anyone. I only know that one must do what one can to cease being plague-stricken, and that's the only way in which we can hope for some peace or, failing that, a decent death. This, and only this, can bring relief to men and, if not save them, at least do them the least harm possible and even, sometimes, a little good. So that is why I resolved to have no truck with anything which, directly or indirectly, for good reasons or for bad, brings death to anyone or justifies others' putting him to death... **each of us has the plague within him; no one, no one on earth is free from it.** 

I'm willing to concede that thinking in this way is a psychological aberration one should try one's best to avoid. All the same, doing so does not get rid of it inside of me and any attempt to do so feels like an attempt to care less about others which a part of me cannot seem to swallow. Here's the truth: I am proud of my guilt. It's some kind symbol of superiority and yet at the same time some kind of evil stand-in for actual action. I can go about my day to day life a little easier knowing that it's there. Yes, I am living in American luxury, making purchases that are morally indefensible, each day a graveyard of wasted time, but at least I am not fully enjoying anything I do. At least, in the back of my mind, I am always judging others and myself. Is a moral framework wherein the amount of negative judgement is proportional to someone's happiness worthy of anything? Isn't the whole point for people to suffer less and be happy more? What's the alternative? Doing whatever we can to ignore others' suffering and enjoying ourselves? Is any middle ground possible?

Okay so I've been thinking about this and I've decided I want to do something that helps me be less of a hypocrite. Obviously Palestine is the biggest example of mothers and children suffering in our world today. My idea is a site that helps you track our daily efforts to ease this suffering. There could be:

1. Donate to a charity
2. Call your senator
3. Spread Awareness
4. Any other ideas?

And then I could use [this API](https://data.techforpalestine.org/docs/killed-in-gaza/) to display some information and visualize some data about the suffering that has occurred and which is currently occurring. I'm visualizing, names of people who have been killed whose birthday was today. Number of days since food/water, etc. 

I'm gonna draw up a quick design on figma and go from there.

### *10:55PM*

Okay I finished the design in Figma, moving on to coding a rough draft.
