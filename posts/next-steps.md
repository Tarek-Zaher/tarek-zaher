Woohoo! I have my own site to experiment on. There's a lot more I need to do to make it my own. I want to learn [TailwindCSS](tailwindcss.com). Back in the day Bootstrap was my go to but it seems like Tailwind offers much more customization which is what I'm going for. Then for the experiences I want to create I was looking at a few different options. As of now, I've settled on [GSAP](gsap.com) which I couldn't be more excited for. It's the exact kind of cool scrolling and animation experiences I want to create. 

For instance, one idea I've had ever since I was a teenager was an animated scroll experience for this poem by William Woodsworth:

## I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud

I wandered lonely as a cloud  
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,  
When all at once I saw a crowd,  
A host, of golden daffodils;  
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,  
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.  

Continuous as the stars that shine  
And twinkle on the milky way,  
They stretched in never-ending line  
Along the margin of a bay:  
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,  
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.  

The waves beside them danced; but they  
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:  
A poet could not but be gay,  
In such a jocund company:  
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought  
What wealth the show to me had brought:  

For oft, when on my couch I lie  
In vacant or in pensive mood,  
They flash upon that inward eye  
Which is the bliss of solitude;  
And then my heart with pleasure fills,  
And dances with the daffodils.  

To me it's just such a beautiful poem with such vivid imagery it's begging to be animated and embellished by the kind of thing I'm hoping to make. As I read it so many cool ideas are coming to me that could even add meaning to the poem, like at the start the explorer is a young man and in the end on his couch he is an old man. Who knows, but first I need to learn GSAP. 

I think a good place to start once I've gone through the basic introduction is a page with some rolling hills and a blue sky and as you scroll more and more daffodils sprout up out of the ground. Sort of like when the forest God steps across the meadow in Princess Mononoke:

From there I can start to chip away at the full poem and making a stunning experience. My friend Nikita just got accepted into a grad school program for poetry so I'd love to get good enough to animate some of her poems one day. All exciting stuff, that's all for now!
