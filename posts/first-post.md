This is my first post on this site! I built it using the Next.js tutorial [here](nextjs.org/learn/pages-router). I like the idea of having full creative control over the site. I have a few ideas for what I want this site to be. 

First, I want to be radically transparent in one section (this is the start of that section). Almost like a daily journal (although I can't promise I will post daily). I'm not sure how personal that will be, but I believe it's extremely beneficial to write *something* once or twice a day. It's important not to just consume other people's thoughts and opinions without ever contriving something of your own. You can do it. Many people go whole lifetimes doing it and I'm sure some of them live happy lives. For me, I feel as if there's a spark of something beautiful inside of my heart. It waits a long time for me to notice it and give it attention. Like a kid, it feels hurt when it's ignored. Noticing that little spark in my heart and writing down what it wants to say is the only way I know of to ease its anxiety. Sometimes it suprises me with what it wants to say. "I didn't know that was inside of my heart this whole time!" I think to myself. Anyways, this section would be devoted to letting that little spark speak as often as possible.

Second, I want to code some unique and beautiful web experiences. I really view web development as a new art form, like painting or drawing. I'm uniquely positioned to have a modicum of ability in it and I want to capitalize on that to build beautiful creations. If I had grown up drawing or painting, I'd choose those mediums instead. As it turns out, I happened to build websites since I was a teenager so its the medium I have to work with. I want these experiences to be educational, poetic, and awe-inspiring. My favorite genre of literature is magical realism because it treats magical, extraordinary occurrences as everyday monotonies. I feel this is the most realistic genre because we do that constantly in real life. All around us at every second are a trillion miracles occurring and reoccurring thanklessly. They are like the little spark inside of my heart. I feel very strongly that they deserve to be appreciated for all that they do for us. I want to say, in one webpage after another, "Thank you clouds." "Thank you ants." "Thank you world."

That's all the ideas I have for my website right now. I'm sure others will come with time. If you've made it this far, thank you for following along on my journey and reading the words that I write! It means a lot. I hope to have something beautiful and helpful for you very soon.
