Woohoo! My full site redesign is complete! It took way longer than I thought it would, but I'm very happy with the results. For reference, here is what it looked like before:

And look at it now! 

This was great practice for all of the things I'm trying to get better at. First, I designed it all in Figma before coding anything. I had never used Figma before but apparently it's the industry standard and I'm starting to see why. I'm still using the free version and getting a feel for all of the features, but I enjoyed using it and the act of designing before coding itself was very fruitful I think.

Second, the redesign has quite a few subtle GSAP animations and getting those together made me much more confident in GSAP. I learned and utilized GSAP timelines, SplitText, ScrollTrigger, and React specific UseGSAP. I really would like to experiment with the SVG capabilities GSAP has to offer (which is why I put those circles in my design, to be continued there).

Lastly, this redesign gave me a somewhat clearer vision of what I want the site to be. As it stands, I don't really have anything worth reading on the site. I love showing it off to my close friends but it's not doing anything for anybody right now. The question "What do I have to offer" comes up a lot when you're designing and building a site. All of those design decisions should be in service of the goal. Most of the time for websites the goal is to get people to signup for a newsletter or purchase a product. I'm not really interested in either of those goals, so the design process was a lot more difficult. 

Right now, I have a beautiful vessel for reading words. I want to publish some of my short stories and essays here that are worthy of the design I created. Then, I want to find a new home for these logs and rough drafts. I like writing them and it's extremely helpful to me, but they're not the right fit for this current design. So whether that looks like a separate page or section or what I'm still thinking out. 

Additionally, I need to stay focused and organized. It's easy to chase every idea but these things do actually take serious time so I need to be mindful of thinking through ideas and picking ones that align with my long-term learning goals and passions. Here are some open ideas:

- The *I Wondered Lonely as a Cloud* animation
- Something entitled *The Warmth of the Sun* that uses that pastel yellow I found and love and which goes through Richard Feynman's explanation of fire and the question of how cloud's float. I love love love those two things and I think their combination is a unique and amazing choice. It would be a lot of animation work though so maybe I need to pick something smaller to practice.
- A fun word game. My girlfriend loves word games (and is amazing at them) so I thought it would be fun to code a game that uses GSAP animations and React. We always share our mini-crossword times every day so something timed and challenging where the user could share a screenshot of their time and share would be cool. I have a few ideas just need to think through them and decide if that's a logical next direction. 

Anyways, that's all for now. I also want to keep writing and getting better so I have some beautiful stuff to publish and share here. Stay tuned!
