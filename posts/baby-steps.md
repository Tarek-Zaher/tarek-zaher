Lots of updates! Firstly, I made it through the GSAP basic tutorial and the ScrollTrigger documentation. I made my first baby step of a little floating cloud animation you can see [here](/animations/floatingCloud).

I also looked through the [ReactBits](https://reactbits.dev/) offering and even implemented the Folder component to a Recent Animations section I created, but it was actually not very functional at all. Scaling it to any size above 1 made it go outside of the margins since it just uses CSS to transform the scale. Additionally, you're limited to three popup files and there's barely any room to fit any content into them. 

It did spark an idea for me of having the navigation bar being an animated folder and clicking the files expands them into view. I chipped away at it for a few hours but I was having trouble and I haven't actually decided on a cohesive theme for my site yet so I didn't want to sink more time into something that I'm likely to change later even though the learning experience was fun. 

In addition to all of this I've been really excited about a project for my favorite band The Irons (who are also my dear friends). I've been working in Figma on the designs and it's really fun. I'm excited to see how far I can take it. 

As far as GSAP goes, I want to learn the SVG plugins next, particularly [MotionPath](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MotionPathPlugin). It's crazy to me how quickly time passes. I feel like I never have time to do all the things in a day that I want to do. I'm gonna start trying to wake up extra early. That might help the days feel longer. Anyways, that's the best update I can give for now, lookout for more on The Irons project!
